If `msg.sender`, `creditorAddresses[creditorAddresses.length - 1]`, or `corruptElite` call back the `lendGovernmentMoney` function, a re-entrancy attack can occur. This can be mitigated by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow**: The contract uses `uint32` for `lastCreditorPayedOut` and `uint` for `round`. If `creditorAmounts.length` exceeds `2^32 - 1` or `round` exceeds `2^256 - 1`, an integer overflow will occur. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library.\n\n3. **Unbounded Loops**: In the `totalDebt` and `totalPayedOut` functions, there are loops that iterate over `creditorAmounts` from `lastCreditorPayedOut` to the end and from the beginning to `lastCreditorPayedOut`, respectively. If `creditorAmounts.length` is very large, this can lead to out-of-gas errors. This can be mitigated by limiting the number of iterations.\n\n4. **Unprotected Ether Withdrawal**: The `investInTheSystem` function allows anyone to increase `profitFromCrash` by sending Ether to the contract. This can be mitigated by adding a modifier that only allows the `corruptElite` to call this function.\n\n5. **No Access Control**: The `inheritToNextGeneration` function allows anyone to change `corruptElite`. This can be mitigated by adding a modifier that only allows the current `corruptElite` to call this function.\n\n6. **No Event Logging**: The contract does not emit events for important state changes.

If the recipient contract has a fallback function that transfers Ether back to the original contract, an attacker can exploit this to drain the contract's balance.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow**: The `Deposit` function in the `PrivateDeposit` contract uses the `+=` operator to add the value of `msg.value` to `balances[msg.sender]`. If `balances[msg.sender]` is at its maximum value and `msg.value` is also at its maximum value, an overflow will occur.\n\n3. **Integer Underflow**: The `CashOut` function in the `PrivateDeposit` contract uses the `-=` operator to subtract the value of `_am` from `balances[msg.sender]`.

This is because the `call.value()` function allows the contract to send Ether to an arbitrary address. If the recipient of the Ether is a malicious contract, it could potentially manipulate the state of the original contract.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow Risk**: In the `Deposit` function, the line `balances[msg.sender]+=msg.value` could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the sum of `balances[msg.sender]` and `msg.value` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint`. Similarly, in the `CashOut` function, the line `balances[msg.sender]-=_am` could potentially lead to an integer underflow if `_am` is greater than `balances[msg.sender]`.\n\n3. **Unchecked Call Return Value**: In the `CashOut` function, the line `if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` does not check the return value of the `call.value()` function.

The `resetInvestment` function sends ether to `lastInvestor` and `owner` before resetting the contract's state. If an external contract calls `resetInvestment` during the execution of `lastInvestor.send(jackpot)` or `owner.send(this.balance-1 ether)`, the external contract can call back into the `Governmental` contract, potentially leading to a re-entrancy attack.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow**: The `invest` function in the `Governmental` contract divides `msg.value` by 2 before adding it to `jackpot`. If `msg.value` is such a large number that `jackpot + msg.value/2` exceeds the maximum uint256 value, an integer overflow will occur.\n\n3. **Timelock Vulnerability**: The `resetInvestment` function in the `Governmental` contract checks if `block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE` before resetting the contract's state. If `ONE_MINUTE` is set to a very large value, an attacker can front-run the `resetInvestment` function by setting `lastInvestmentTimestamp` to `block.timestamp - ONE_MINUTE - 1`.\n\n4. **Centralization Risk**: The `Governmental` contract is owned by the `owner`. If the `owner` account is compromised, the contract could be hijacked.\n\n5. **Unchecked Call Return Value**: The `resetInvestment` function in the `Governmental` contract calls `lastInvestor.send(jackpot)` and `owner.send(this.balance-1 ether)`. If either of these calls reverts, the function will continue to execute, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.\n\n6. **Insecure Randomness Source**: The `Governmental` contract uses `block.timestamp` as a source of randomness"

If this timestamp is changed in the future, the function will not work as expected.\n\n2. Centralization Risk: The smart contract relies on the timestamp of the blockchain to determine if the sale has finished. If the blockchain's timestamp is manipulated by an attacker, this could lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTTOU) Risk: The function `isSaleFinished()` checks the timestamp at the time of the function call. If the timestamp is changed between the time the function is called and the time the function is actually used, this could lead to incorrect results.\n\n4.

This could lead to unpredictable outcomes in the `payOut` function.\n\n3. **Leader's Privileges**: The `payOut` function assigns the `leader` variable to `msg.sender` if `msg.value` is greater than or equal to 1 ether. This could potentially allow the `leader` to drain the contract's balance by repeatedly calling the `draw` function.\n\n4. **Function Visibility**: The `randomGen` function is declared as `constant`, which means it doesn't modify the state of the contract. However, it returns a random number based on the current block timestamp, which could potentially be manipulated by a miner.

This could potentially lead to a re-entrancy attack if the fallback function is called again before the balance has been transferred.\n\n4. Transaction Value Check: In the fallback function, the contract checks that the transaction value is exactly 10 Ether (`require(msg.value == 10 ether)`).

If the `bank` or `msg.sender` contract calls back into the `play` function, a re-entrancy attack can occur. This risk can be mitigated by using the `call.value` function instead of `transfer`.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow**: The `pot` variable is incremented by `msg.value` in the `play` function. If `msg.value` is equal to `TICKET_AMOUNT` and `pot` is already at its maximum value, an integer overflow can occur. This risk can be mitigated by using SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.\n\n3. **Insecure Randomness**: The `random` variable is generated using the `sha3` hash of the `block.timestamp`. If the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by an attacker, this can lead to insecure randomness. This risk can be mitigated by using a trusted source of randomness.\n\n4. **Centralization Risk**: The `bank` variable is set to `msg.sender` in the `EtherLotto` constructor.

            "There are several potential security risks in this smart contract:\n\n1. **Re-entrancy Risk**: The `sweepCommission` and `transferOwnership` functions could potentially lead to a re-entrancy attack. A re-entrancy attack occurs when a function modifies the contract's state and then calls back into the contract before it has a chance to update its state. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: The contract uses `uint` for arithmetic operations, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if the numbers are too large or too small. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.\n\n3. **Lack of Input Validation**: The `claimThrone` function does not validate the input `name`. If an attacker can control the `name` input, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or potential loss of funds.\n\n4. **Lack of Access Control**: The `sweepCommission` and `transferOwnership` functions are only callable by the `wizardAddress`. If the `wizardAddress` is compromised, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.\n\n5. **Lack of Event Logging**: The contract does not log important events such as the transfer of ownership or the sweep of commission. This could make it difficult to track the contract's activity and potentially lead to unauthorized access.\n\n6. **Lack of Gas Limit**: The contract does not set a gas limit for the `claimThrone` function. If the function is called with a large amount of Ether, it could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and potential loss of funds.\n\n7. **Lack of Timelock**: The contract does not have a timelock for the `sweepCommission` function. If the function is called, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.\n\n8. **Lack of Function Visibility**: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `sweepCommission` and `transferOwnership` functions. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access and potential loss of funds.\n\n"

A re-entrancy attack occurs when a contract calls back into itself, potentially leading to a denial of service or loss of funds.\n\n2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: The contract uses the `uint256` data type, which has a maximum value of 2^256 - 1. If the value of `k` exceeds this maximum value, an overflow will occur. Similarly, if the value of `k` is less than 0, an underflow will occur.\n\n3. **Use of Hardcoded Addresses**: The contract uses hardcoded Ethereum addresses (`0x96a65609a7b84e8842732deb08f56c3e21ac6f8a` and `0xaa27f8c1160886aacba64b2319d8d5469ef2af79`) for the `contract_address` and `c2` variables. If these addresses change, the contract will not function correctly.\n\n4. **Unchecked Call Return Value**: The contract does not check the return value of the `call()` function. If the `call()` function fails, it will return `false`, but the contract does not handle this case.\n\n5. **Function Visibility**: The `transfer()` function is declared as `public`, which means it can be called from outside the contract. If this function should only be callable from within the contract, it should be declared as `internal` or `private`.\n\n6. **Function Signature**: The contract uses the string \"register\" and \"transfer(address,uint256)\" as function signatures in the `call()` function.

However, there is no check to ensure that all addresses in the `_tos` array are valid. If an invalid address is passed, the `call` function will revert.\n\n4. **Function Signature**: The `bytes4 id=bytes4(keccak256(\"transferFrom(address,address,uint256)\"));` line creates a function signature based on the string \"transferFrom(address,address,uint256)\".

If the called function throws an exception, the `transfer` function will also revert.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, consider the following suggestions:\n\n- Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent re-entrancy attacks.\n- Make the `transfer` function `private` or `internal`.\n- Valid"
